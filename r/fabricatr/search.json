Statistically, function generates “Poisson-distributed” count data. one typical distributions used count data. Second, model radio covarage, might believe radio coverage example skewed data; words, urban areas might extremely dense radio coverage, many rural areas might low radio coverage. , thus, need data distribution looks like :  R makes available fairly simple function generating sort data, rlnorm, generates log-normal data. Log-normal data one key distributions used model data skew like one hypothesize: example, income data population (relatively wealthy people substantially income relatively many working class people). rlnorm takes three arguments: n (number observations), meanlog (mean log-transformed data), sdlog (standard deviation log-transformed data). Replicating real data important inference draw modeling results depends “support” (range values observations take) “density” (many observations take value); extent real-world data likely dense regions data sparse others, important synthetic data well order recover inferences accurate future real-world inferences, particularly uncertainty inferences.  Observe uncertainty around predictions far wider right end support, relatively little data, left end support, data lives.
